This repo contains my personal website. 

The current contents are...

1. scripts/main.rkt - This script was inspired by Dr.Van Horn's [website](https://github.com/plum-umd/dvanhorn). This script generates the 
html that the site uses. The current goal is to keep expanding the script myself overtime.
2. Index.html - Generated html for the website.
3. stylesheet.css - The css for the website. 
4. resume.pdf - My resume! The repo for which is [here](https://github.com/ivan98q/Resume)

The code is freely reusable, the image is from Github though I'm currently not using it. The content of the site is owned by Ivan Quiles-Rodriguez
